# Press Alt To Meow

The recently published Game [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/) has a dedicated meow button.
Why doesn't Minecraft have one too?

Well, now it has!

If only the client has this mod installed, only the client will hear the sound
If it is installed on the server too, all other players in range will hear the sound too (even when they don't have the mod installed)
